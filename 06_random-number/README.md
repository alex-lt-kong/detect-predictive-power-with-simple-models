# Pseudorandom Number

## Dataset
A series of (pseudo)random numbers generated by `random.randint(0, 1)` with `random.seed(666)` on `Python 3.9.2`. 3.9.2's [official document](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/random.html) states that
>  Python uses the Mersenne Twister as the core generator. It produces 53-bit precision floats and has a period of 2**19937-1. The underlying implementation in C is both fast and threadsafe. The Mersenne Twister is one of the most extensively tested random number generators in existence. However, being completely deterministic, it is not suitable for all purposes, and is completely unsuitable for cryptographic purposes.
