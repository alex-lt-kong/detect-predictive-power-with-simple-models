# handwriting-recognition

This project is NOT meant to reproduce how well a neural network (no, CNN is not involved...) or other modern machine learning models can do the job. Instead, it tried to understand one question: say we know that feature set **X** does have very good predictive power, is it possible to use a very simple model to discover it without relying on domain knowledge?

If the answer to this question is yes, then it implies that, while having a fantastic (i.e., very accurate) model is hard, it is comparatively easy to decide whether or not some features have predictive power (since very simple models can detect its existence). In this particular case, say a fine-tuned neural network can be 99% accurate in recognizing hand-writting text, a linear model which is 55%-60% accurate could lead to very strong conclusion that causality exists (just a linear model is not flexible enough to uncover it).
