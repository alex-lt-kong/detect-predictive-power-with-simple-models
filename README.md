# handwriting-recognition

This project is NOT meant to reproduce how well a neural network (no, CNN is not involved...) or other modern machine learning models can do the job. Instead, it tried to understand one question: say we know that X does have very good predictive power, is it possible to use very simple to discover it?

If the answer to this question is yes, then it implies that, while having a fantastic model is hard, it is comparatively easy to discover whether or not some features have predictive power (since very simple models can detect its existence).
